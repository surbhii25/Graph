/*
Depth First Traversal or DFS traversal can be used to detect a cycle in a Graph. DFS for a connected graph produces a tree. 
There is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge present in the graph. 
A back edge is an edge that is from a node to itself (self-loop) or one of its ancestor in the tree produced by DFS.
