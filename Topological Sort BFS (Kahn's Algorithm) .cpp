/*
A DAG G has at least one vertex with in-degree 0 and one vertex with out-degree 0.
# Proof: Thereâ€™s a simple proof to the above fact is that a DAG does not contain a cycle which means that all paths will be of finite length. 
Now let S be the longest path from u(source) to v(destination). Since S is the longest path there can be no incoming edge to u and no outgoing edge from v, 
if this situation had occurred then S would not have been the longest path.
=> indegree(u) = 0 and outdegree(v) = 0

# Algorithm: Steps involved in finding the topological ordering of a DAG:
 - Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the DAG and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.
 - Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)
 - Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.
           Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
           Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
           If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.
 - Step 4: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.
 - Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph then the topological sort is not possible for the given graph.
