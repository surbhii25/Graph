/*
We are gonna use Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sort in this question. Topological Sorting for a graph is only possible if the graph is a DAG.
If we are unable to generate Topological Sort in this question then we can say the graph is not DAG, hence cycle is present in the graph.
Basically, we are doing reverse logic to do this ques.
