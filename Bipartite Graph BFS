/*
Bipartite Graph is a graph that can be colored using 2 colors such that no two adjacent nodes have same colors.
If the graph doesn't contain an odd length cycle then it is a bipartite graph.

# Algorithm:
1. Assign RED color to the source vertex (putting into set U). 
2. Color all the neighbors with BLUE color (putting into set V). 
3. Color all neighborâ€™s neighbor with RED color (putting into set U). 
4. This way, assign color to all vertices such that it satisfies all the constraints of m way coloring problem where m = 2. 
5. While assigning colors, if we find a neighbor which is colored with same color as current vertex, then the graph cannot be colored with 2 vertices (or graph is not Bipartite).
